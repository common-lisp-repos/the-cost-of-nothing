A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

This is a simple benchmark suite that tries to estimate the cost of
individual language features of Common Lisp on a given platform and
implementation. I hope you find it useful.

To run all benchmarks, simply type
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results output
(asdf:test-system :the-cost-of-nothing)
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(the-cost-of-nothing:enlighten-me!)
#+END_SRC
