A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

These are some portable benchmarks and tests to estimate the cost of
individual Common Lisp operations on the given platform and implementation.
I hope you find it useful.

* Usage
To run all benchmarks, simply execute

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results output
(asdf:test-system :the-cost-of-nothing)
#+END_SRC

To obtain the execution time of an expression in seconds, type
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(benchmark EXPRESSION)
#+END_SRC

To measure only certain parts of an expression, type
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(nested-benchmark
  (foo)
  (bar)
  (benchmark SUBEXPRESSION1)
  (let ((a (baz)))
    (benchmark SUBEXPRESSION2)))
#+END_SRC

Furthermore the library exports the following functions
- MEASURE-EXECUTION-TIME
- MEASURE-EXECUTION-TIME-OF-THUNK

* Final Remark
Please do not forget

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are lies, damned lies, and benchmarks.
