A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

These are some simple benchmarks to estimate the cost of individual Common
Lisp operations on the given platform and implementation. I hope you find it
useful.

To run all benchmarks, simply type
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results output
(asdf:test-system :the-cost-of-nothing)
#+END_SRC
or
#+BEGIN_SRC lisp
(the-cost-of-nothing:enlighten-me!)
#+END_SRC

And please do not forget

There are lies, damned lies, and benchmarks.
