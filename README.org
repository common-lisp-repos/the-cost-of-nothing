A LISP programmer knows the value of everything, but the cost of nothing.

These are some portable benchmarks to estimate the cost of individual
Common Lisp operations on the given platform and implementation. I hope you
find it useful. To run all benchmarks, simply run

#+BEGIN_SRC lisp :results output
(asdf:test-system :the-cost-of-nothing)
#+END_SRC

The benchmark-related symbols are exported and may be useful for other
projects, too.

And please do not forget

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
There are lies, damned lies, and benchmarks.
